# GitHub Markdown Templates

This repository contains standard GitHub markdown templates that can help improve your project's productivity. Our templates are a bit different than others in that we have repurposed the Code of Conduct to link to coding standards to allow the standards to be kept up to date without you having to pull the files, but this comes with the requirement that you check for updates periodically.
